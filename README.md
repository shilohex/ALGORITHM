# ALGORITHM 
# Word and Vowel Counter

This Algo code reads an input string and counts the number of words, vowels, and total characters. The input string is terminated by a period ("."). The program uses a basic pseudocode-like syntax for clarity.

## Usage

1. **Input**: Enter a string when prompted. Ensure that the string ends with a period to signal the end of input.

2. **Output**: The code will display the following information:
   - Number of words in the input string.
   - Number of vowels in the input string.
   - Total number of characters in the input string (excluding the period).

## Code Structure

- `N`: Input string variable.
- `T`: Index variable used to traverse the input string.
- `words`: Count of words in the input string.
- `vowels`: Count of vowels in the input string.
- `totalchar`: Total character count in the input string.

## Code Explanation

1. The code reads an input string until a period is encountered.
2. It counts words by detecting spaces and vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
3. The total character count is calculated excluding the period at the end.

## How to Run

1. Copy the algo code into a  compiler or interpreter.
2. Execute the program.
3. Enter an input string when prompted.
4. Review the output with the word count, vowel count, and total character count.

Feel free to modify and enhance the program as needed!
